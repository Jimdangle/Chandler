b'who&#039;s your favorite ',665294971,b"who's your favorite yellow- anon?",b'I found the writing/dialogue and moment-to-moment gameplay significantly more engaging than Yellow at the same points (Dark Ruins vs Ruined Home- Snowdin vs Starlight Isle)- I\'d understand disliking Koffin Keep because it\'s a long dragged out adventure game joke and if you don\'t find it funny it\'s just filler to you (I liked it though)They also didn\'t fuck up writing Sans and Papyrus which is an incredible feat for a fangame- the final encounter with Sans/Crossbones was genuinely well done on any route to boot; I can get why some people don\'t mesh well with the game but I think that it does "Undertale" better than Yellow and if it can carry the momentum it has displayed to the rest of the game I think it will surpass Yellow as a wholeIf you prefer Yellow because storywise it is pretty much its own thing within Undertale\'s setting- I\'d understand- but I think TS!Underswap has genuine merit'

Kotor\'s different- though. It\'s one of the only games that actually provides a sense of comfort- from the farms on dantooine to the endless oceans of manaan- which is what made malak actually seem somewhat threatening once he bombed dantooine. Revan and bastila is still one of the best romances in vidya- and the backstory of the mandalorian and jedi civil wars in the game built a new- unique world (because if nothing else- bioware knows how to worldbuild.) The rakatans were portrayed excellently with the buildup they\'d gotten from kashyyyk- dantooine- and the sand people- and finding out that they were the remnants of a long-dead empire was eerie. If I could live in any video game universe for nothing but its scenery- kotor 1 is one of the two I\'d go with.'

That's why in the new TV canon she basically hijacks Luke's role after the OT and Heir to the Empire.That's why she doesn't call herself a jedi and doesn't have to abide by their rules- but is also called a jedi by everyone else and is somehow training her own padawan to be a jedi.Theoretically I'm not opposed to the idea of some jedi surviving past the OT- as long as they're some random jedi who couldn't have affected the main story too much. But Ahsoka is OP as fuck- knows Vader personally- and is in touch with all the main rebel leaders. Her being alive during the OT will never make any sense."

b'Kurosaki Koyuki',665234767,b'Kurosaki Koyuki',b"You're asking too many questions- Sensei. It's your fault if you get raped- you know."
b'Kurosaki Koyuki',665234767,b'Kurosaki Koyuki',b'Why would you need more than two sparks right now?'
b'Kurosaki Koyuki',665234767,b'Kurosaki Koyuki',b'Thank you. In the upcoming potential events- I think jp school summer and get set go is good to farm? I want to plan my pvp coins. They will probably be zero this month.'
b'Kurosaki Koyuki',665234767,b'Kurosaki Koyuki',b'So you only activate the skills and manage cooldowns? Is there any degree of complexity or is it just "if your units have the raw numbers and you click the abilities you win"?'
b'Kurosaki Koyuki',665234767,b'Kurosaki Koyuki',b"Half a spark for S.Ui- in case you don't get her from 100 free rolls. Remember- rate-up is a lie. Maybe more- if you want S.Hinata too.A spark for S.Hanako. And a spark for Wakamo. There's a ~70% chance to get a previous Anniversary hyperlimited student on a new Anniversary banner- if you spark twice. Which I did on Mika's. Yet I didn't get Wakamo or S.Hoshino. Neither I did get Wakamo on S.Hoshino's release banner."
b'Kurosaki Koyuki',665234767,b'Kurosaki Koyuki',b"There's also positioning. The initial student placement in the squad- as well as during the fight- using students with repositioning skills. But- in general- yeah- that's all. It's a  game after all.Oh- but wait- there's also the skill rotation to keep in mind."
b'Kurosaki Koyuki',665234767,b'Kurosaki Koyuki',b"thankfully I'm not you"
b'Kurosaki Koyuki',665234767,b'Kurosaki Koyuki',b"plsIt's sort of an auto-battler? You build your team- and then the characters will move through map and target enemies automatically- but you decide when and where their special skills should be used. Personally I thought that the campaign was pretty fun- with proper team building (even without super meta units) and good skill usage it was possible to clear stages while like 20 levels under recommended one.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxpJIOA80zANormal missions have maps that you have to go through- but there's also other modes- like base defense- skirmishes against unit groups from specific schools- Raids with unique mechanics- and other challenges with weird stuff.The actual story is visual novel styled- like is common for these games."

b'Kurosaki Koyuki',665234767,b'Kurosaki Koyuki',b"I can't be raped if I consent."
b'Kurosaki Koyuki',665234767,b'Kurosaki Koyuki',b'which school has the strongest students?'
b'Kurosaki Koyuki',665234767,b'Kurosaki Koyuki',b"Let's face it- Total Assault is the meat of the game- not the missions you do once and then sweep. So if I had to pick one as a demonstration- it'd have to be Greg because of the music."
b'Kurosaki Koyuki',665234767,b'Kurosaki Koyuki',b'Ok I think I get it. How much content is there in general and how much time does the game demand on a daily/weekly basis?'
b'Kurosaki Koyuki',665234767,b'Kurosaki Koyuki',b'11'
b'Kurosaki Koyuki',665234767,b'Kurosaki Koyuki',b"There's some planning involved- since different characters are useful for different kinds of content.The damage types are obviously something to take in mind- then there's if you want AoE damage or single target- normal missions have small board games you have to play- and raids have mechanics that can get surprisingly in-depth."
b'Kurosaki Koyuki',665234767,b'Kurosaki Koyuki',b'Gehenna. Why? Because Trinnity was created from a bunch of Academies that banded up together out of fear of Gehenna. Gehenna was always strong.'
b'Kurosaki Koyuki',665234767,b'Kurosaki Koyuki',b"Around 15-20 minutes to do the dailies (unless you're malding trying to 1-team Insane difficulty raid- when you don't have the most optimal team for it). But that's after you've cleared all the Missions. It's gonna take some more time while you're still progressing and possibly trying to get 3-star ratings on the missions while you're at it."
b'Kurosaki Koyuki',665234767,b'Kurosaki Koyuki',b"And how are the rates? I know it's a gaccha so salt and FOMO bullshit are expected but how merciless is it?"
b'Kurosaki Koyuki',665234767,b'Kurosaki Koyuki',b'I want Toki to milk me'
b'Kurosaki Koyuki',665234767,b'Kurosaki Koyuki',b'I\'ve been progressing through Main Mission while 20-30 levels below recommended. Now that was pretty challenging and "fun". But sometimes actually fun- when I did manage to clear them.Being able to progress and unlock the next Cafe upgrade early- instead of leisurely farming past stages- leveling and gearing up- greatly helps you later- because the more AP you spend daily - the faster you level up.'
b'Kurosaki Koyuki',665234767,b'Kurosaki Koyuki',b'u ready for blue fest right?'
b'Kurosaki Koyuki',665234767,b'Kurosaki Koyuki',b"Pretty good amount. The main story should last you few days- and they've been putting old Events on archive- so those are also easily accessible.We'll also get like one new event each month- and rerun of old ones. The stories of those might take... Hour or two to read through- depending how much content there is?10 minutes for dailies after you don't have immediate things to do. The game is very forgiving with sweeping- since you can do that with any mission that you have gotten a three-star clear for.Obviously you'll spend more time when Events come up since they have stories to read through- and Raids depending on how tryhard you want to be."
b'Kurosaki Koyuki',665234767,b'Kurosaki Koyuki',b"The rates are fairly standard- 3% for 3-star students. Not sure about rate-up compared to other games- it always feels like rate-up is a lie- when you have bad rolls. But probably should be around average too. Spark is 200 rolls- which is whole 33% cheaper than in Granblue.But what's most important- imo- is the amount of free gacha currency you get for free from daily activities and stuff. Like around a hundred rolls a month- maybe more. BA just might be TOO generous. Hopefully that doesn't impact their revenue too much."

b'Kurosaki Koyuki',665234767,b'Kurosaki Koyuki',b'3% chance to get a 3-star student on a single pull. 200 pulls for a guaranteed pick of current banner student. The pity points DO NOT carry over between banners.Free players get enough currency for 200 pulls at least every 2 months. That does sound kind of miserable- but going all the way to 200 is more rare than not. And Global is behind the JP schedule- so we have decent idea of what the most meta students are going to be.Also- thankfully many of the very solid ones can be farmed with time. Either from missions- raid shop or other places.And many of the 2-star and 1-star characters are actually very usable. They see regular use in raids even at late game.Yeah- I really liked going through the missions while I was under-leveled. It was fun actually making it through by the skin of my teeth- and trying different teams until I could beat the boss that was blocking me.'

b'Kurosaki Koyuki',665234767,b'Kurosaki Koyuki',b"If you are thinking of starting- now is pretty good time. We're gonna have 10 free pulls per day when the next event starts tomorrow. The featured characters aren't insanely good- but you can also pull non-limiteds- so that will be good way to build up your units.But after that there will be a special banner with doubled rates. And the featured characters will be very good.New players should be able to get enough gacha currency from story and regular progression to get 200 pulls before the special banner is over."

b'Why is this game so kino ',665282730,b'Why is this game so kino yet an absolute fucking mess?',b"I disagree with every point in your shitty pajeet pasta. The writing was sincere and came from the heart. Much better than all the generic Netflix-tier slop that gamers pretend is deep. Cast of characters was probably the best in the last 9 years. Bossfights were decent. Cliff had godtier setpieces and Higgs was a nice callback to MGS. The giant BT fights were pretty cool.Combat mechanics are decent. Sam is not a skilled fighter- just a porter. Controls are much better during combat when you put cargo away. Bola gun can only stun BTs and it works because Sam's blood is in the fibres of the wire. BTs are a good concept. They can be very time-wasting and slow you down if you fuck up. Which is exactly the sort of enemy you need in a game about deliveries. Also very fitting thematically. Blood grenades should always be plentiful- no reason for them not to be. You should be able to use every tool in the game at any time. Margaret was fine. Troy Baker was clearly having a lot of fun. Good casting since he played Joker in Origins and this is a similar character. Collectibles were alright- it was just cool shit that Kojima likes. The world itself is very nice looking and joy to traverse through. Every beautiful sight felt like a discovery. You find the optimal path and optimize it further- that's the fun of the game. Roads take a long time to build and require materials from enemy camps. You also have to connect and traverse the area first if you want any help from players. It's difficult enough- more on the chill side but it's more about eliminating tedium than difficulty. They are literally 3D-printed- it's intentional that things look the same.You wear a uniform that serves a purpose. That's why you can only change colors in the endgame. It creates stronger variants of helpful grenades Baby only cries when you fuck up It's about giving people hope- packages are just a small part of that."

The entire plot should have revolved around conquering the rest of the mountain because a McGuffin is at the peak. But it\'s so dangerous that many die on the expedition.

You do not have an opening to switch when you're playing Katalina if you want to play her optimally- maybe 10 seconds every minute or so if you're cheeky. Otherwise you need to be skill canceling and positioning to keep Ares up as long as you can- something the ai will not manage if you swap.

It shouldn't ever be taken seriously or even just entertained. No game has ever lost players because they refused to 'balance' something. This has not happened once in anything but the most outlandishly extreme cases of the game becoming unplayable for the majority. What correlates most with dropping player retention is actually the act of balancing a game.

A single payment + DLCs might work but then you can get a pretty tense relationship with your fandom the moment people feel like you're overpricing them like with Total War and the problem with Pay 2 Win becomes an issue. You could do a subscription service but I don't know how many people would be willing to do that for a Shooter- even if it did offer massive maps and combat numbers- the game would have to offer more in regards to social stuff and I imagine it will start heavily favoring Platoon scale gameplay mechanics at the detriment to single player.

Heavy Assault was always by a large margin the most populated class- followed by Infiltrators and Light Assault- so lots of dudes with fucking shields- LMGs and excessive explosive power have always been an issue.It was a huge contrivance to create literal parking spots for Sunderers to safely set up camp at every base. It both caused Sunderers to become exceedingly difficult to destroy and led to all infantry fights to become an extremely funneled chokepoint shithole- the defending team unable to reach the Sunderer because it was behind 700 troops. Meanwhile- a Sunderer that isn\'t in a designated parking spot is either half a mile away or an easy target.It was honestly not much different in PS1. The AMS would be parked next to the basement side door of a facility- and the only reason it survived so long was because the attacking team dominated the outside- constantly shelling the few doors that led outside while those tiny fucking hallways were packed with soldiers.Making the Sunderer more generally beefier and utilitarian in addition to removing those safe parking spots should be ideal.

Unfortunately it came out literally before broadband was a common thing...but it also came out before publishers thinking they wanted tards to spend $20-200 on a cosmetic individually and that the market would put up with it.

b'Can it be saved?',665275735,b'Can it be saved?',b'One of the best things about original PS was that an Infiltrator was not just a "i\'m going to get into sniper position and then let them have it" class. In fact the sniper rifles didn\'t even FIT in the stealth suit. PS2 fucking this up was disappointing. Original Inf had room for very- very few pieces of kit- a sidearm- your combat knife- and usually a hacking/med/engi kit depending on your spec. You could spend 30 minutes actually playing SOLID SNAKE MODE to sneak into an enemy base- slowly trying to be sure nobody sees or hears you (note that hearing you is big thing. The faster you move- the more noise ou made and some things - like the more powerful melee knife setting had a noise to it so if you heard WUBWUBWUB behind you- you were about to get backstabbed - louder. You were not fully invis- you were ALMOST invis if you were still and crouched but the faster you moved the easier you were to see. So if there was a base enemies were using to resupply with lots of resources- or a pivotal "linked\' facility- getting inside it and hacking it secretly- or even blowing up their generator to make it no longer able to spawn or do anything else that took resources for the base..was one fuck of a rush'

b'&gt;&quot;Kill the men!Ta',665279437,b'What did the goblin meant by this?',b'Modern rape-goblins originate from 19th century literature at the latest. "The Princess and the Goblin" is a children\'s book about a princess that\'s kidnapped by goblins who want to marry her to their leader. My professor back in college claimed the poem "The Goblin Market" by Christina Rossetti was feminist allegory for prostitution and rape- the goblin\'s seed being an allegory for semen. It\'s not the biggest stretch considering some verses and the author\'s interests. It\'s also just a trope for pretty girls to be kidnapped by monsters. Some people\'s analysis of that one seems off though. I think it came from people using the words "goblin"- "changeling" and "incubi" interchangeably- leading to them becoming perverted in fantasy.With DD2 they probably gave the goblins a few rapey lines like how they ogres are horny. It\'s suggestive flavour text meant to make the goblins evil and if their exact intentions get revealed I can guarantee it\'ll be something murderous and not sexual.'

The characters are all the same within a gender (outside of extremes like Jack) up to maybe about a 10% difference. All this image does is further prove the point. It is especially noticeable in Tag 2 and 7 when you put them in bikinis for the girls or just shorts for the guys.

It's the best evolution to what the survival horrors games were trying to do. The problem here is that thanks to the new 3D engine the game uses- I miss the beautiful pre-rendered backgrounds. It's weird how they went full action game on DC2 and no other RE even got close to it. See Code Veronica- the closest game (in release time) to DC 1. The zombies do not follow you across rooms- for example. The puzzles are the easiest ones in the series- too. And as far as I remember- it's also the easiest RE game- being the first I could do a knife only run without any problem."

Now that Ryujinx works pretty well with AMD cards you unironically have no reason to use or endorse Yuzu anymore- unless you're very unlucky or have a potato pc. Ryujinx can play games on day 1 if not before release almost perfectly in most cases (latest relevant examples for me being TOTK with minor issues that got fixed 9 days before release- Rain Code and Mario Wonder running perfectly) meanwhile Yuzu always lags behind. Ryujinx also has working online scene to play games like Mario Kart 8 or MHGU. You should use both anyway- because certain games will have better framerate on Yuzu like 13 sentinels."

One amusing misunderstanding you could have in this scenario would be bright crimson-colored fake hairpieces getting popular after the lizard people heard that there's an exotic and rare breed of red-haired human."

Who knows. To integrate better? To start spreading out more?It's ancient- hivemind- kalpa-hopping tree bullshit.As far as we know- the souls of Argonians dont really go through the same channels other elhnofey souls go through. The Hist- supposedly- takes back dead Argonian souls and places them back into new lizards. The tree network apparently works as their own Dreamsleeve.However- LDB's dragon soul is likely a direct gift from Akatosh- considering LDB appearance came from out of nowhere. No dragonborn ancestry more likely. So its possible that Akatosh just found an Argonian soul in the transitionary period between death and Hist capture- gifted it the power of a dragon soul- and BOOM- Argonian dragonborn.

Argonians are literally lizards that were transformed by hist sap- the hist is like their mother.The hist is thought of as sentient trees- but it\'s more than that. It\'s a network of sentience that can extend itself. Turning lizards into argonians lets the hist create entities of itself to move past its roots and protect itself.I think lizards were chosen because they have small brains.The hist are lingering "divines" that joined lorkhan to create mundus- the same as human- and elves.So the hist probably based their creation on the strongest races like humans and elves. And since they are aping the design- then the breasts probably hold nutrients like hist sap which is necessary for argonians.Btw TES:O is not canon in any way'

It was a binary decision player choice narrative whether or not if it made sense. Either he's a hero or a dick- there was no lead up.Neat gimmick- but barely explored at all.It was moon swinging- and you're criticizing SM2 for an additional feature you don't have to exploitIt was more arcade style driven- a matter of preference really."

He just tells Harry to take some schizo pills at the very end and the narrative for Peter just goes into high gear the moment Miles gets taken and it's not character driven. The monster just turns him gay even speaking into his earWhat the fuck are you talking about?Yeah. Ps5 Spider-Man has moon swinging and no physics. It's all scripted even without swing assist. But I will because swinging in the game is pointless since the game does faster travel through flying and air tunnels for you.Can you be more vague? What is Ps5 Spider-Man combat to you if it isn't arcade driven and doesn't need strategy. It's also not reactive since your abilites always work on every foe. You don't have to pay attention to their movesets. All you look out for is the little color on Spidey's head"

I know this is 4chan- but I get tired of the constant battle- you know?It's a AAA superhero game anons bring up and compare to this all the time- especially with combat. How is it not relevant to the conversation? And where did I say AK is a 0/10? It's not. Granted weaker installment to the series that's flawed- but still has things to like about it. Now it's sounding like you are doing what you accused me of- attaching your identity to a game you like. Let's be better- okay?And how am I objectively wrong? With swing boosts and web zipping- things that were in the first game- you can get around fast just fine. Web wings are a feature- not a requirement- except for that one side mission. And no- the game isn't perfect either. 3rd act really does have issues."

It's your fault for ignoring a mechanic they developed. Now you're telling us we're absuing it in some way lmaoThey're chases. Plural- ESL.

Citing a source based on various other discussions people have used- frequently done between games- is completely acceptable. You\'re just mad that you can\'t think of a proper counterargument to it.You\'re abusing the feature because you yourself are actively choosing to play the game that way. You can web swing around the city just fine without it- and can play the game 95% of the time like that. Your own logic can be applied to "well web zip is broken!". So now you\'ve goalpost moved trying to make a single side mission appear more than it is? Now this reeks of desperation or intentional shitposting. Cmon now. You can web swing on or through the bridge. You are choosing the other method. That\'s not forcing the player at all. That\'s YOUR choice to play.You mean Mysterio\'s boss fight and Mister Negative?

That's why the tunnels exists and why flying is faster and more precise and why missions are attached to it and why we're flying to islands with no buildings in main missions. I've been telling you this since we started this convo- ESL. Not my fault you aren't able to readOr you could go much faster by taking the tunnels the developers put in to make you fly faster instead of hindering yourself risking a loss of your speed and momentum. I am chosing the right path because the developers have put it in. You're deciding to play like a retard and ignore a mechanic the developers put in there.Yeah they want you to fly.

b'everybody copies wow but ',665291363,b'everybody copies wow but runescape is the only mmo with a growing player count',b'Runescape had a foundation laid by geniuses. The current people running it are intelligent in all the wrong places. They can make competent things (Guardians of the Rift was excellent) but then they go and shit the bed with "Forestry" which SHOULD have been a skilling game like WT or even trouble brewing. The amount of effort they put into sailing (whyyyy) will make or break OSRS and at that point it shouldn\'t be OSRS.Still- OP is correct. The holy grail would be something that plays like a 3rd person game- has an intelligent system that isn\'t just a cool-down rotation (OSRS actually has some really good deep mechanics that come on very slowly wading into the late game). The trouble is that building the base OSRS took YEARS back when standards are lower. They\'ve kept up or surpassed standards but making a real MMO that plays well is one fucking gargantuan task- but implementing all the genius alternative skilling ideas takes at least that much time again. Nobody has the budget to do it- or at least the talent to do it. OSRS barely managed it- because it runs on a little grid and sprites.'
