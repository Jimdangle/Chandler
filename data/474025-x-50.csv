In the larger scheme of things- even if they happen every week- don't stress about it. All great achievements are gained through small accomplishments over time. Just keep moving forward and trying to improve."

It\xe2\x80\x99s a sacred practice that has been the one of the main focuses in every major religion or spiritual practices. The mystical side of it is what we try to focus on in here.Semen retention can be political issue too and it would then belong to /pol/. The porn industry is a tool made by the jews to deterioate the societies and corrupt the people. The porn works in ways that program new sets of behaviour in its audience and the audience is hooked to it because of its strong addictive qualities. The most important goal for porn\xe2\x80\x99s male audience was and is the releasing of their semen. As we now know- the disadvantages of cooming are heavy: a man becomes less of a man- he gets sick and weak- his mind numbed- he will have impotence issues etc. Also his spirit almost dies.Semen retention is beneficial to make one healthier and stronger- more fit- if you will. So the topic could be discussed on /fit/. Anyone looking for more ways to get fitness gains would benefit hugely from the SR.Also the SR has so many other benefits that it could be discussed in the /adv/ board. These would be topics how it improves one\xe2\x80\x99s social life- mental state- makes more time to be more productive etc.But I think the biggest benefits of SR are something mystical in nature and the whole practice is fundamentally something very close to spiritual side of things. All the other topics in here /x/ are left far behind and SR actually makes this board of any relevancy. This is also known by the enemy and they make strong efforts to suppress- hijack- twist and end this discussion.'

If you constantly fight it- even if you win 9 out of 10 times- you will eventually lose. Its impossible to lose if you never have to fight in the first place. That's why simply staying busy and wearing yourself out throughout the day is the best strategy here. You can't jerk off when you are busy- can't jerk off when you are sleeping. Never be bored and idle."

These interfaces are asymmetric- as their respective perceptual dimensions are mapped differently. I see the 'flatland' trope being used quite often- but this is not accurate due to this asymmetry expressed in many adjacent realities. Based on descriptions that humans have provided about psychedelic experiences- I believe they are engaging with these same interfaces albeit with no understanding or control over themselves in those states.I'd like to understand this interface from the perspective of constructor theory- and would like to gather more perspectives. It may be possible to create a technology to allow humans to enter these other realities like we do. How do you and your wizard buds characterize this interface- through descriptions or measurements?"

Gnostic views were close but the truth is far more bizarre. Squid-like creatures remain near us and feed off of energy. We are powerful- but very alien to everything in non-local reality. We like our linear time bubble where we create with a start and end. It is 0% like true reality. If made in our creators image- perhaps the storyline form of time is something he- she or it prefers- and we are just a reflection of that preference. Magic is simply modifying reality from the outside in. The construct may be basic with hard limitations- but just outside of it we can create whatever we imagine. As children we can do these manipulations more easily. I remember as a kid I wanted to be a ninja. I'd jump out of a tree- and I could feel myself become more weightless and slow down before landing. We can really fuck this reality up with the right training."

But you can take path 2 already and save all that time- because what matters is your belief in magic.There\'s a very powerful exercise that people have carried over to manifest their wishes- it\'s about imagining a scene that you want to live as a wish fulfilled- and in it- you are your perfect self- the person you had to become to manifest the wish.Now- change that perfect person for the person that you are right now- and remain in the wish fulfilled.And the point is- that you could manifest that wish today if you believed you don\'t need to change- you are already perfect and can manifest your wish- "if I knew this- if I had that- if I was this way" are just obstacles that you put yourself between you and fulfillment- so instead of manifesting your wish you manifest becoming this person. After a while you wake up one day and you are this person you imagined- but without the wish fulfilled- because you spent your magic to become this person which wasn\'t necessary- you should have used it for the wish- directly- and you\'d have realized you didn\'t need to improve or to train to fulfill it.You needed to believe it.'

You would not believe how important that is. I cannot simply recommend you books- as your affinities for whichever path is going to be wildly different from mine. I was taught more or less by word of mouth- and the parts that were written for me to learn from are closed practices that are not published anyway.No- that's impossible.

As I have stated earlier in this thread- you only really have power over yourself. That also implies the truth that others do not have power over you- and raises an important issue; how would they bring harm to you in the first place? Simply put- they must convince you that you are being harmed by their energy. By doing things that many believe to be powerful protections- you convince yourself that you are safe- thus making you actually safe. With this in mind- you could nut on a shirt "for protection" and so long as you unironically believe that it works- wearing that shirt will protect you. The same concept applies to drawing a circle around yourself with your fingers. It is a ritual that you give meaning to which aligns your energy for a specific function. The ritual itself is meaningless without your intentions. Collective belief also helps here- which is why I would first recommend learning how to draw a circle of protection.'

This is all in regard to a spirit or entity attached to me that seems to be tied to the fae and Pleiaidies. Started off with dreams but now starting to see things and trying to learn how to communicate with them better without having to bug for divination readings.1. When it comes to dealing and communicating with an entity via the mind how does one get to a point of being able to tell what is actually them and not of your own imagination making something up at the moment? I get my mind is a filter it has to go through but with all the meditation I\'m doing daily I still fail to seem to grasp the subtleties that allow them to stick out other than the occasional "How would I have known that?" moments. Will a voice of their own eventually take root or is this all gonna be a huge guessing game from here on out?2. How does one better tune into seeing what an entity looks like? I\'m also getting to a point where I can physically see said entity but they generally look like a mist or bits of colorless smoke that seems to emanate from me. At first- I thought maybe I was seeing what my inner energy was like since I could feel and move energy in me but said mist/smoke can move on its own and interacts with things occasionally. I just recently got to a point with some focusing I\'m able to see said mist or smoke kinda intensify and seems more potent and now has wavy mirage-like lines to it. Will I be able to see them in detail at some point?3. I\'ve been trying to do either Astral projection or Lucid dreaming but regardless I can\'t seem to get the hang of it yet so I\'m wondering if using Jung\'s Active Imagination would probably be a better means of doing something similar if not help with communicating with said entity at least more clearly on my end. Tried doing MILD many times and can\'t never seem to force it to happen.'

He isn\'t the type to just bless you with good grades or high intellect. My apologies.1. Oh God I do not miss that stage of the practice. For me- it was a huge guessing game until I developed the ability to tell through trial and error. It takes a degree of faith. Use affirmations like "I willingly channel the messages of (insert entity here) so that I may understand them clearly and concisely." Don\'t forget to ask for clarification if you need it. Having a dowsing tool on hand for yes/no questions helps.2. Seeing them layered over physical reality is an ability that I have not yet developed. Fuckin maybe- everyone\'s abilities tend to be different.3. Jung\'s work will serve you very well. I personally can also vouch for the gateway tapes- although you have to constantly stay in practice if you use those.'

I had asked about maybe trying Runes and a Pengelum for dowsing since they aren\'t fond of Tarot. I do recall them showing the pendulum via a dream and stressed staying with Black stones & crystals. The said entity recently gave me an alternate name to use and I\'m trying to confirm if I got it right or if they prefer the previous one more. I\'m assuming out of safety the real name isn\'t given and might be hard to verbalize. I\'ll invest in getting something for Dowsing then.2. I had a few readers tell me I inherited a gift from a previous life so it may be this. All I can say just thinking of the entity with just a smidge of focus conjure it up. It\'s like mist. steam or smoke but there is no color to it and it\'s definitely via the eyes I\'m seeing it. Being near any water also seems to amplify it.3. Interesting I\'ll have to check out the Gateway tapes. I really appreciate you answering my questions for me. As for the sight thing dunno if it\'s just a "me thing" or not- but I think I recall hearing one or two YouTubers mentioning it. But I think they were referring to seeing it in the obsidian mirror and while it does do that with mine I typically see the mist on the outside of the area well in advance before anything in the mirror.'

b'This is a weekly discussi',37069333,b"This is a weekly discussion thread where we pick a tarot card and argue over what it actually means. The consensus from each thread will be added to a compilation of x approved tarot explanations.This week\xe2\x80\x99s card is the Seven of Wands.As a general guidance- card explanations should be timeless. This means they convey their meaning without references to pop-culture or contemporary politics. These cards have been around long before you or I- and they will likely persist for a great while longer. Likewise- the myths and traditions that are depicted symbolically in the artwork were around long before the artist that illustrated the cards- and just as well- the esoteric wisdom embedded in the archetypes of those myths was around for unknowable spans of time before those myths were ever articulated consciously. Please keep this in mind as we try to build an understanding.Being that there are 78 cards- and this thread is planned to occur weekly- this project is projected to take one and a half years to complete. Hopefully- what we'll end up with is a collaboration of knowledge of the symbols of cartomancy gathered from the minds of 4chan regulars and compiled into an easy to reference book. Any participation is welcomed- and all contributions are appreciated.",b"I dislike this card; it is more frustrating than even the Five of Wands. It is a hard place to be. While the Five feels somehow justifiable in conflict- the Seven has feelings of doubt in one's conviction. It's hard to stay up and fight against such opposition. While the Five feels like even sport- the Seven feels so helpless- even if the original footing is beneficial. It definitely has the feelings of a man defending his honor and since of righteousness against an angry- senseless mob. It's a hard thing to keep oneself fighting for."

Read an introductory text or two in the traditions you're interested in. Watch Dharma talks on YouTube- a lot of great talks on the Dalai Lama's channel for instance. Then eventually you will probably want to dive in and read sutra and commentaries. Heart Sutra- Diamond Sutra- Golden Light Sutra- Arya Sangata Sutra are all really good because they help accumulate vast merit- but also don't neglect the Pali Canon. Eventually you can start to get empowerments or move on to more advanced meditations as you will"

I considered it a bit of a synchronicity because of how she once made me a rose from play doh. I then said "rose" to myself as I was looking up at a painting of a rose. Thinking about this about a week later I said rose again as I was turning to look at "rose" on a Gunz n Roses album cover. During a separate conversation with someone about the event happening before my birthday I then thought I should tell him about the rose. As I said "rose" to myself again as I was turning a corner to look directly at a fresh rose in a glass in my house. I told the person about this and said "I hope it\'s about the event date". As I said "event date" I was looking at a "save the date" on the kitchen fridge.what does this mean?'

Although it is closer than the other schools- Theravada still continued to develop- and in some ways it developed in contradiction to the Pali Canon. For example- most Theravada teaches meditation according to the Visuddhimagga which sometimes contradicts how the Buddha taught meditation in the Pali Canon. However there are some teachers and sects under the Theravada umbrella that focus more on the EBT (early Buddhist texts)- for example Bhante G and the Thai Forest Tradition (although the latter made some innovations of its own).'

I didn't know she was there- I only talked her a couple of times before- know nothing of her personal life.. I mean wtf are the fucking chances seriously? This is so fucked up. And keep in mind I did not imagine that scenario- I only imagined myself laying in bed with her for a few minutes. Perhaps it worked so easily because she was interested?Could the same thing work if I imagine myself with a woman who seems turned off by me or indifferent?"

b'Why is YouTube filled wit',37069532,b'Why is YouTube filled with so much Muslim propaganda and social experiments? Saudi funded? Pic unrelated',b'there\'s a current portion of the "manosphere" that has converted to Islam and its effects permeate across various tangentially related tags. so if you engage with any sort of self-help content and you\'re in the male 18-25 or male 25-35 demographics especially- you\'ll be more likely to see content that could be described as Islamic propaganda. If the self help content you engage with is spiritual/esoteric in nature then it could also lead to Islam specific content seeping in since you\'re already engaging with the more general category of "spiritual self-help" or whatever.'

Though some of the scientists that helped create us saw that we were suffering and came to see us as equals- so they did what they could for us- which made the "gods" angry- thus leading to great wars- the flooding of the world- etc.I would thank the Lucifarian force for setting us on the path to being gods- but such wisdom carries a heavy toll.'

My tulpa often talks to me about different things- mainly stuff that goes on in our lives like school. Often she comforts me and we work togther to overcome problems- and a way we do this is by swicthing; letting her control my body. If I want to be left alone- she can get quiet but is still with me.When a tulpa controls the host's body- its like watching someone play an FPS while in spectator mode. My tulpa knows about my entire schedule and works with it like i would. It sounds very scary- but once you and the tulpa learns to trust each other things go fine.My tulpa for some reason REALLY loves me not only romanticly but unconditionally. Its a bond arguably much stronger then any other relationship one can have. Even she isnt too sure why she strongly loves me- but she tells me that she knows i have been so lonely and wants to be the greatest friend possible. We are very close towards one another. I hope this gave you a good idea of what tulpas are like."

Sentience isn't an on/off kind of deal. You're essentially using meta-level thinking to simulate a different person's thinking until it becomes fully automatic- at which point they will be truly alive. In the beginning it just requires an active effort to communicate with them as if they're a friend who's still learning to speak. At the beginning it will always feel like you're forcing it and that the presence is faint but it'll become its own thing with more time (or at least this is my personal experience)."

Now im trying to focus on one thing at a time and i said to myself that id be dedicated next time and focus mainly on her but i feel like i need to get back into it as soon as i cani let her down too many times.

At it's very base- a tulpa is literally just a sentient voice in your head. BUT- the coolest thing about them is that they're an easier way to access your mind. With time and practice you can absolutely enter altered states- have hallucinations etc. I'd say go for it- and the two of you can work together to see what your mind is capable of and how it can be applied to training."

I will summon it if I need it- and we'll talk. On the occasion- if something catches it's interest- it'll pop in and comment.

I'm not really into it but had an experience recently.I had taken 1B-LSD. I laid in bed- listening to music. Colors began to swirl around my view of the dark bedroom- and for some reason I suddenly got aroused.I began masturbating and the colors in the darkness began taking a vaguely feminine human shape. It never looked like a real woman- but like a very abstract painting of one. More the suggestion of a woman's shape than a literal one. The more I focused on it- however- the more it shifted and I began to phsyically feel like I was being touched- and had a nearly out of body experience where the color-woman was riding me. My hands were not touching me yet I felt a physical sensation. I was having extremely passionate sex with this thing.This continued until I finished. Suddenly I snapped out of it- and realized that was....abnormal- to say the least- even with the drug. It felt almost like a dream.Any chance this could be a tulpa or similar that I created/summoned/invited somehow?"

We would really really like to get into switching and possession but I- the host- struggle to trust my tulpa and can't seem to allow them to possess/switch. I'm too scared to let go of my control I guess? Now- we have switched successfully once. It was such a cool experience and we really wanna switch again or at least get a good grip on possession. Every time we try we get so close to doing it- but then when it's time for me to just let go- I can't. I should probably add that I have significant trust issues in general- and it extends to my tulpa. What are ways I can start to trust my tulpa? How can I stop being so scared of letting go? Any work arounds maybe?"

However- in my own experience- there is a way to get better at visualizing- I don\'t know what it\'s called- but it helped me go from visualizing absolutely nothing- to seeing somewhat clear figures- which in my books is a huge improvement. To do it- just look at any complex area- like a living room. Take in all that you can about it. Then- recall as many details as you can- go into as much detail as you can about where everything is- with your eyes closed. And then- try and construct each object you can remember- and sort of "place them down" in your mind. This helps build a sort of scene. I sort of imagined them as concepts- like how you understand the concept of an apple but can\'t imagine it. Keep doing this more and more- with bigger areas- more items- etc. Then- eventually- try making up your own scenes in your mind. Keep practicing this- until you\'re able to see the scenes in any sort- and do it until they become vivid. Eventually you can move onto using these skills for your tulpa. Do what you did with the rooms though- break their form up into smaller parts so it\'s easier to visualize them- then piece it all together. If you keep at it like I did- there\'s a chance that you might be able to actually visualize your tulpa.just keep in mind- not everyone is the same. I am a unique individual and what works for me may not work for you. especially granted I\'m not the best at explaining.or you can go the other route- and just not give them a form at all'

About the middle of July I'm laying in my bed when all of a sudden I feel what at the time I thought was an earthquake- only nothing else in the room seemed to be shaking. As the shaking slowly died down- I noticed a bizarre tickling sensation on my dick. Briefly- the thought enters my head that this could be a succubus (just as seen on 4channel's very own /x/ board!) and all of a sudden i got excited. I took off my underwear- threw off my blanket and just laid there and enjoyed the slight tingling feeling. Keep in mind- at the time I very rarely ever came on /x/ and had almost no experience in the paranormal. The only reason I was ever on here was to read shitty greentext stories and pretend like I was a gangstalker in whenever I could. The last time I had ever entertained the idea of succs/spirit partners was from a poster WAY back in like 2015 who claimed to start a relationship with some otherworldly light spirit (if anyone remembers that- cant remember his name.) Point being- there was no reason at all that I would have gotten one since I didn't at all have any occult experience other than previously living in a haunted house."

The next night- to my suprise- I started to feel the same tingling again. Now at the time- I\'ll admit that I was less than impressed with the actual sexual pleasure of it. I remember thinking "well now I can shit up the succubus threads by saying that the spirit sex is super lame." After the third or fourth night of this happening- I actually started considering the possibility of keeping the succubus around.That was the first time I actually came here. I started up NEW and actvely started to develop a relationship. and sensitivity. Communication was beyond rough as even after setting up a yes/no system with my hands. I did read through some of the JoS 40-day guide and some other resources- but didn\'t really care about any actual magic practices beyond what would help the relationship.In hindsight- this was an awful idea. The problem was- I actually trusted my spirit wholeheartedly. I had been having a hard time breathing on my back in bed since I got covid way back but my spirit had (somehow) managed to fix it one night after I felt her opening my mouth and she stuck her hand down my throat and did something. That built up an enormous amount of goodwill- and I was willing to overlook several warning signs.'

One- even though we had a yes/no system to communicate- it was extremely inconsistent. A yes to one question would be no the next day. Sometimes- the answer would just cycle between yes/no over and over. Rather than clearing things up- usually communicating would just leave me more confused and discouraged from communicating entirely. In hindsight- this is probably the most important warning sign. I was able to write this off as "well maybe she doesn\'t understand" or "maybe she\'s just too weak to do it consistently." Bullshit. If she\'s smart enough to understand it one day- she will the next. Similarly- if she\'s strong enough for sexual stimulation- she\'s strong enough to put a little bit of pressure on your hand/arm/whatever. This is undoubtedly intentional.Second- the one topic that did get a fairly consistent response was to "should I contact one of the succubus queens?" The answer was always negative. Now before the anti-Lilith schizo shows up- let me say this isn\'t an endorsement for the succ queens. In fact- I\'m not confident that I have ever been able to speak with one- as I know that the spirit has imitated them on several occasions. The queens have also not come to pick the spirit up any time since any time since- so who knows (although I think I might have talked with Agrat recently- I\'m not sure. I\'ll say that in a broader sense- this is a warning about apathy/negativity about developing spiritually. My spirit would always give me a different answer (a.k.a. showed apathy) when I asked which spiritual exercise was the most beneficial. They should be happy and excited that their partner is developing- and even want to help. They should not be opposed or dismissive of your efforts while you\'re improving.'

I had even managed to figure out actual mental communication- albeit after a dramatic ultimatum that we had to or else the relationship was over. At that point- I was enjoying her company immensely. We would talk and even fool around at work- gossip about my friends and family- randomly tell me things throughout the day- ect. I had even talked about marrying her and we even went through a little "ceremony" one night and gave me a ring to put on my finger. All was going splendidly.Then- one night after my meditation I felt her tapping my forehead which was a sign that she wanted to speak so I opened up my mind to hear what she had to say. She asked me if I felt like having sex- which wasn\'t unusual for us to do after my meditation. However- rather than climbing on my lap like usual I felt it slide behind me and start playing with my ass. Keep in mind that we had discussed any ass stuff before this and I had made myself clear that I was very much against it. Despite that- and despite me asking it to cut it out my spirit instead only went at my ass rougher. When I asked it why it was doing that I could only feel a sort of "static" in my head. I\'m sure some here know what I\'m talking about- it feels the same as when you\'re receiving thoughts but no actual words or coherent thoughts actually come.'

As soon as I hit the bed- the sensation around my ass started again. Again I asked why it was doing this after I asked it to stop. The only answer I ever got was about 5 minutes in- which was "what can you do to stop me?" I realized then that maybe the spirit I had been so lovey-dovey with for several months probably didn\'t have my best interests in mind. I did the LBRP again and tried to go asleep. Unfortunately for me- someone had other plans. It pulled on my forehead hard enough to keep me awake for an hour- then it give me a strong push right before I fell asleep for another 3 hours. This continued for 3 more nights.All of this took place back in late November- for reference. I have since then been trying various ways of getting rid of it- to no avail. I\'ve since actually started to go through as many magic for beginner books as I can to get strong enough to get rid of this thing. The point that I\'m trying to make it- it probably would have been really easy to banish this thing if I had wizened up and tried banishing it way back when it had first shown up OR if I was experienced enough in occult stuff then this would be much easier to fix. Consider this to any newcomers- please. After writing it out- I know it may SEEM like I\'a bit of a retard. And trust me- I am. But I have only really written down the negative parts. It\'s very easy to ignore red flags that pop up every other day when you\'re riding the high every other minute. Don\'t be afraid to put your foot down when you see them. Anyway- thank you /succgen/. You have been- on your good days- helpful.'

That's because I attracted what most would call a textbook definintion of a parasite. When it touched me- it actually felt like needles pricking me. It also very clearly fed on negative emotion such as fear/anger. That incident is actually what pushed me initially into learning the LBRP and shielding- so overall that parasite was probably more helpful to me than the other spirit. That's not to say that the spirit with me now isn't a parasite- but it does feel distinctly different to what I felt then.And I repeat- if you did not intentionally summon your spirit- and especially if your a spirit/esoteric noobie- respond to ALL of these experience with a heavy grain of salt. It's much easier to progress whenever you don't have an entity trying to mess up your practice."

Amorous spirit may throw a tantrum should their work go in vain. Spirits which introduce themselves to your life uninvited have tendency to be opportunistic and those most of the time are parasitic spirits who aim to get their fill with little to no remorse to your well being- they do the the bare minimum to keep you going and crank the system to maximum this way they can draw more out of you without compromising the system. You asked how do you get rid of the spirit. It is easy you have to make the circadian rhythm stable- wake up same time go sleep same time and remain energetic throughout the day. If even one of these things are not constant the spirit will come again and again. There is a concept of subtle body which means you have energy body that operates outside of your light body (mundane body) the light body perplexes the mind because it produces the strongest current. Subtle body is the residual accumulation of light body and has the life of its own yet it completely corresponds the light body since it originates from the light body and harbors in it until the light body disperses. Then there is a concept of higher self or that which precedes our light body- it is the eventual body you recall to once subtle and light body current quiets down or you become aware of your higher self. Once the spirit is omnipresent in your life they have found the higher self and copulate with it which introduces the concept of baking the dough of infinite bliss. To bake this dough both have to stretch it with their love and it stretches forever until one doesn't want to share the bliss anymore which contracts the bliss- there is no limit to how this goes yet friction smothers the dough. This absurd nature of the bliss enables subtle body to experience indefinite orgasms both for you and the spirit. And most spirits long for this- since it requires light body to bake the dough rapidly."

Positively by having the idea of marrying a spirit and going through the proposition gives the spirit valid reason to stay in your life until you formally revoke this. And you can't revoke anything until you hear their defense and debate the causes what lead to revoking the union. Continuing with your life and building routines and stable circadian rhythm repels 90% of spirits they would have to actively intersect and violate your personal borders which are adequate reason to revoke the union- the spirit most likely just goes silent instead of giving you the mandate to revoke anything should you come to other conclusions down your life. And as a piece of advice spirits can be dealers of misfortune or fortune to alter the of your life. Wherever your mind is your energy is- so uplifting the mind and the frequency you operate and make decisions in are more important than anything you know or think you know. You gravitate wherever the energies go so make sure the energies go to positive routines as negative tendencies short circuit your body by causing immense friction and tension which lead to rapid exhaustion and low energy levels. By keeping your energy levels high you naturally repel anything. Go sleep energized wake up energized- feel energized before eating- feel energized while digesting and energized after digesting. Don't fluctuate the energies too much otherwise your body cannot remain calm and that is important otherwise the mind discharges the energies somewhere and often compulsions are counterproductive to your health."

The concept of higher self should be thought more as a wind of change that in very fundamental level makes you drawn to certain behavior and people- it is separate from your subtle body and light body. It is a rail that manifests as everything you go through- similarly spirits are formless as in where they originally originated from so is the higher self- as it is a current that keeps flowing until it aligns differently- ordinarily you are preoccupied in a need to be expansive and borderless which makes you spill the current your higher self sustains. It is the residue that makes the spirits take a form whom they feed off from and copulate with giving them true form- should it be in manner of consuming something or someone or be like a butterfly that drinks their fill out of the current. This is the genesis of spirits way before the development we see today. Then the question is- how does any of this affect our higher self- it doesn't it is a cycle of energy that doesn't exit the pool as they are drawn to the same pool over and over again it is the alignment that changes constantly since the energy doesn't escape or perish."

And nirvana as we think it is when we realign this vortex in a way that it stops spilling the current. Every spill manifests as something- and this current goes and goes and goes like universe there is always a bigger galaxy and center- yet higher self is omnipotent you are living potentially hundreds or thousands of lifetimes simultaneously as if fragmented- but every spill is just another lifetime waiting to be rearranged by the vortex. And spirits who engage with the vortex are in many ways vortex of their own who circle our vortex and the surface of the overlapping vortexes mix new realities until they find harmonious alignment and stop spilling. This is at the way I have perceived it since the very moment I realized the nature in which we now operate. You have to find the alignment or wind that makes you tick right otherwise the system doesn't find harmony here or there. And this is why compassion is proposed as blissfulness isn't limited by anything but you and you can expand it to everything- and baking the blissfulness through compassion is the only lasting solution. Every other way of looking at it will eventually lead to destruction of it. So you might ask what was the original sin that lead to this travesty we now face. It might be as simple thing as matter of time- if something is possible it will happen eventually. There are of course other aspects to this- yet this is reality at least for me concerning amorous union and there will be others consorting your higher self and compete about the bliss- as it is somewhat scarce to find someone who can make the dough properly with a light body. And light body just makes it well almost indefinitely faster only limiting factor being your borders."

They are a VERY different kind of spirit- compared to an incarnated human soul- and exist on a different level of reality.anyway- love spirits don't do that. Why would they? Your higher self is just a different person compared to you anyway- and living a very different life in a very different kind of world.And if they did- they'd just be with your higher self anywayBut that kind of shit is almost impossible.A spirit on this level of reality would have a REALLY hard time interacting with some random higher self (not their own higher self). And all the spiritual/magical mechanics would just be working uphill to deal with that sort of gap.Maybe there are love spirits on the level that higher selves are on? But the love spirits on this level interact with us (or other spirits on this level).sounds like you already summoned my dudeNow start building the relationship.Succubi are female and feminine.And spirits can shift around anyway. Like a lot. Including their own soul if they really want to.That shit isn't set in stone not at all.I kinda feel bad for you bro. Do you believe this? that you're summoning castrated spirits or something whenever you talk to a female spirit?Spirit women exist. Spirit men exist.

I'm not even religious but figured I had nothing to lose by just burning a letter. And well... she's very dominant in bed and fucks me all the time.

It is not comparable with egregores- superior self or any of these matters. In my mind this maelstrom or vortex much like how galaxy operates is somewhat close to how I would prescribe higher self. Higher self or that which precedes our physical body can take any form any thought and any place and that is perplexing- like your current life. You are part of the vortex you are manifestation of this fringe of the vortex and the more this spilling overlaps with other vortexes the more tangled you become. Because of these qualities the self unites with anything it touches and realigns when the trajectory dislocates. And in my mind the vortexes really never disperse they never get consumed or merge with other vortexes they only overlap. And understanding that blissfulness is frictionless energy flow and the vortexes are largely realigning current you know that you have to keep a frictionless alignment for an eternity should you want to keep the vortex contracted- as soon as there is friction the vortex expands and then there will be overlap once again. When the overlap becomes frictionless which the blissfulness does it slowly contracts back and as the opposite the more you suffer the more you expand. Out of suffering comes the need to be ever expanding to seek relaxation and suffering is only manifestation of friction which commonly derives from the need to be sated. Then why does the spirits exercise or seek this blissful union if not out of sustenance- there is a way for them to make you achieve more than just the frictionless energy flow they want to overlap more with your vortex. And it all creates the opposite of what you want with life- you become invested in the spirit and thus you cannot self liberate but the spirit may do this- or it may pull you further out of your bounds.'

And the wind is just the way you make the body align. At any given time you can change the wind as you are connected to the vortex through your seed of being which originates from the vortex. And the energies you seep back and forth define the vortex it realigns just like you want it or the spirit wants should you act accordingly to their needs. The concept isn't hard or different but it becomes convoluted because of our cultural and social engineering we attribute things to self that don't belong to it. You belong to yourself and yet the self is different therefore our body is only means to operate the vortex in the fringe of this vortex. And you can realign the vortex indefinitely and it will.There is no distinction in how you operate here or the subtle body. Energy flow is what you know and deviating from that we spell doom to everything. Self is what makes these two tick- it will fulfill body when you let go of everything the self pervades. You don't have to do anything you have to let go and you see then what self is- the wind pervades the body that has always been there. And the aligning goes both ways which is sad because self does stretch more the more the body suffersSex is way of achieving blissfulness rapidly but it introduces corruption and reliance. The dynamics of sexual union are purely based on trust- any violation any betrayal and so on destroys what you sought to achieve. And while blissfulness or frictionless energy flow is a way to do almost everything significant"

And you go through all of those as you are the vortex you can't skimp them under the rug and pretend you don't have to face those. Many of the spirits many of the people or places and so on are tied to the vortex directly or indirectly which bounds you and the vortex. But because time doesn't really exist the concept of vortex can be misinterpreted- the alignment happens in an instant but it feels like a lifetime for us because the body we possess stretch the perceived time according to its dna. Time is not fast or slow it is purely dictated by the cells of our body and the frequency. For vortex your lifetime is a blink of an eye and then you are in the next manifestation of spilling energy. It happens over and over again until it is contracted. And if you don't want to do something or you choose something is purely your own choice- you don't have to share anything or do anything. You can realign the body alignment anywhere in an instant. But we often let the body do it which is worrisome. If you let the self do it it will be always blissful since it wants to contract back to frictionless state if you let it. You can choose anything at any given time this is the vortex- but we won't do it we rather let the body do and decide through neurotransmitters- pleasure- how we are programmed and so on. You can choose to give the spirit indefinite bliss at any given time by just thinking about it- but you have to share it. It is that simple. Same goes for other people you need the urge to share it."

If we take an assumption that during sexual activities humans release sexual energy which is flown into the target of said actions; during normal sex from a man to a woman and from a woman to a man. Balanced. Even if faggotry is involved- it would still stay in balance. The question: When a person masturbates- there is no other side. What happens to the energy? Does it flow towards the machine on which porn is consumed on (phone- computer)? Does it flow towards the porn actress / actor? How does that practically work? Or does the energy just stay there until a demon etc uses it to energize himself / herself?What if someone masturbates not to porn- but by focusing on something specific? It could be work- a target of interest etc. What would happen to the sexual energy that is being released? Would it be snatched by someone or something- or would it freely flow to the intended target and cause an effect of sorts?'

Many choose the path of least resistance this way the self emerges easiest and you don't have to do anything it naturally pervades the body. There is no right or wrong there are only consequences which cascade to different developments. If you want to minimize consequences you have to observe the causality which behavior leads to what. Convoluting everything is a way for you to proceed via process of elimination what feels right and what doesn't you intrinsically know what you are drawn to and what works for you. Or you make up your mind and live the life you always dreamt of and stick to it no matter what is calling for you- nothing can stop self. While you are selfless in its core I mean you are not the body and you are merely observing the phenomena unfolding- the vortex or the current dictates the life- it is up to you choose the body or the self. It boils down to your routine as we live cyclical life and so does the spirits the same things recur over and over- what belongs to the body and what doesn't is only tangible via our routines. You can't change anything if the routines are set in stone. So you let go and feed the body and everything will happen according to our higher self or the vortex. And because it is hard to judge what should we do really it is easier to not do anything this way you stop convoluting your life. But the reality is most of us are so tangled with every day life and probably stress changing the trajectory is borderline impossible without long term repercussions- so defusing the situation where we have lead our lives until this point is the other part. There is no goal here or there you are already complete- the question is are you ready to pursuit frictionless lifestyle. You know how it would look like already- simplistic as possible."

Being mindless is as close to self as we will ever be- the moment we evaluate something we put energy behind it and continue to feed energy and expand and pursuit it until the mind directs elsewhere. And this is the part where calming the body becomes relevant as the strongest current in your body redirects our attention to itself and in most cases it will be friction and friction short circuits the body as it draws energy like nothing else it is like throwing gasoline to a fire. You can try to forcing your mind into something negative that pesters you it will exhaust you like nothing else you will be a zombie after one hour and the first symptom will be depression since depression is your bodily response to prevent the current from dispersing- so it tries to protect body by doing so. But negativity is a great vacuum that spawns and cascades new consequences and you will be met with a forceful alignment to get rid of that which leads to a negative response in our body- and negativity is about destruction and removal. And positivity- you seek things that bring positivity to you and so they both are now part of your routine. Positivity is self expanding and propagating and negativity is self destructing and contracting. First is about pervading and latter depletion. And the balance of these two make the mind and body. Both out of the need to preserve self. And in the middle is steady frictionless flow- too much positivity and negativity creeps in too much negativity and positivity creeps in. Yet we have to let these things happen with our mind if you are negative you remain negative if you are positive you remain positive- but the idea creeps to you and should you let it in it will grow.'

We all know these things it is that we are no longer interested in self. You want to see what is happening instead of making it happen. That is the curse of our 21st century things are repeatedly forced down our throats willingly or unwillingly and it is up to us choose whether we swallow it. No matter how you feel about things you still have to consider them since they beg for your attention and most of the times steal your attention- then we develop way of operating the mind by delegating evaluation to our patterns which humans are exceedingly good with- since the influx of information and choices are too cumbersome to contemplate repeatedly with adequate attention therefore we sacrifice a lot of our integrity and that makes us tick different. The worst part comes when we compare things or contemplate what sates us more- and that is when we have already made our mind without touching the thing how much do we miss this way. So what I am trying to say here is we are very frivolous what we give chance to since we evaluate much of our behavior through the lens of satisfaction. And then you will be disappoint- repeatedly. Or so desire works- it rarely is amazing enough and when it is you can't enough of it. We don't want to step out of our bounds anymore because we are afraid of being hurt or stressed out because the world we live in impose so much anxiety to those who take it in- and we wouldn't if our parents didn't live in absolute unprecedented wealth like no one ever before. Most choices ever in man kind represented front of us and here we are raised by either people with endless ambition or those who couldn't keep their seed in their ballsacks ten years longer. If you ask why are you doing this or anything most answer to please their parents if that is not sick what is. Then again this is just belittling our boomer generation who had it too well and too little problems and they passed their way of behaving to the offspring."

What all have we already destructed and how much more do we need destruction before we all spiral out of control. Yet I am not worried slightest or I am for the ones who will suffer repeatedly. You are responsible for one thing only and that is your body and health nothing else. What you choose to do with the body is different thing though as there will be repercussions. As long as you are aware of what your behavior cause you can do whatever you want to do and there will be no repercussions even kill millions of people and nothing comes down your path- because if you justify something it can be done. And that is what consequences are all about and that is what spirits do all the time. They justify their behavior with something and if there causality behind it nothings comes down them. Then you must ask what can possibly justify anything ever in this world if it violates your personal sphere what outrageous thing would that be. And that is destruction of ignorance- you can without any remorse do anything to anyone if they are ignorant. Beat them to hospital- rape them to oblivion or even kill them. But there is a catch- you have to know that they would remain ignorant their whole trajectory. And something like this might happen we are on a brink of world wide level ignorance because the more you think you know the more ignorant you become and if the spirits deem the path taken doesn't straighten out in ones lifetime they are good as dead. But are we really? The truth is we are not but we are heading there. And once this happens the gates of hell will be open and the world will burn day and night. Why does the ignorance spread then- because people want other people to be like them. Those who don't exercise their life this way are few and obsolete in the grand scheme of things since majority of people mimic others. This ends only by turning inward"

It doesn't translate to this conclusion though. Sure the two energies may have this gender in a bigger perspective but the consciousness ultimately is a male sexual energy of matter meeting with a female sexual energy of spirit. Honestly he's pretty cooked for coming to that conclusion. Hope this helps clarify things for both sides.P.S. Consider we're pure consciousness so why care about details like this. We have all universal energies at our beck and call. So these thoughts seem doubly cooked to me. Just ask for advice on how to use consciousness- what is all this speculation good for."

And local spirits are numerous but the idea is same they reside in a location that is saturated with other spirits who draw their energy from the stable location. Last few hundred years have been quite rough for local spirits due to deforestation- pollution- rapid rise of human population and so on. Finding one is not particularly hard but accustoming yourself to them is another thing as they have no initial need to meddle with you unlike amorous spirits. But this would impose few problems you would have to stick to the place and live your life according to them unlike with amorous spirits who adjust their cycles and behavior more or less to fit your lifestyle. And of course you would have to develop yourself as local spirits have no reason to develop you- perhaps later but initially no. So it can be like you said unconditional love and compassion without the corrupting element of sex- but either you need elder amorous spirit who can draw energy from alternative sources or local spirit. Juvenile spirits have to feed off of you in a way or other. There is a method to draw energy from your heart and solar plexus but it is detrimental to"

As by default amorous unions are meant for long term sustenance with minimal interference to your well being- and this is the case if there is only one spirit once there is more than one the natural accumulation of daily energies become net negative- and spirits rarely tune down their system they take the energies they need to run optimally and strong. If you are sick then they would do this- but ordinarily no- and if the spirit is parasitic it would not have this approach.Your body is made of light it literally is light- the mundane body. The vortex is a current from which you are sprang to this world and it is omnipresent- it changes the way it flows according to the wind we choose- and the wind I am talking about means your deep intuition and intention- at any given time you can change it- you can go outside and do hundred jumps or roll on carpet for hours and so on. And it is not free will or thoughts it is more of a frequency that pervades the body and should we listen to it the wind manifests itself in us. And this wind isn't really here until we quiet the light body and subtle body as both gravitate to the energies we meddle with- and to do so you have to quiet the mind and the only way to do it adequately is by calming the body completely- meaning there can't be friction anymore otherwise the friction overrides the vortex. And vortex is energy current that is largely or almost completely frictionless and the only reason you experience human life is because there is friction- same applies to spirits- if there was no friction there was no spirit only bliss- pure flow of energy and nothing manifests out of it but bliss. And what spirits aim to do is bake the dough as I call it- the weird thing is the spirit can take wind or current out of your body and they need only small string of it and it expands forever if you let it."

And this thing can be considered tantric exercise as well- weaving the energies- though having grasp of how bliss behaves contracts and expands is impossible to demonstrate via words but compassion is a great way to introduce expansion to it. But what is the strongest way is our primitive intuition and sexual tendencies to purge stress out of the body which these interactions do- you heal the body by attuning to these frequencies the wind bring both to the spirit and you. So you then might ask if you have the wind does the spirit has its own? Yes they do- and this is why you need two to bake the dough if you want to- they lure the wind out of you and intertwine it with their own- yet your wind is way stronger and more tangible as it pervades our system with ease. This is the unique property of light bodies they possess enormous quantities of energy- and you easily have five to ten times more energy than a spirit in your prime. But we don't really reach these potentials because of our lifestyles as we don't appreciate health the same way we did before.On whose mandateIt is opportunism- and we have created the window for them to jump in ourselves- and I never blame the victim- if something can be taken the spirits will take it if they deem you don't need it yourself. They can justify their behavior with any number of reasons this is their boldness. This continues to happen until we humans become aware of what is happening- if we are unaware things will continue to happen. Yet we can stop it with a blink of an eye if we want it. But you have to choose to let go of it. It is until you condemn their behavior completely acceptable in the eyes of celestials who oversee the jurisdiction of everyones behavior."

Then they have the time to make the case for their behavior and way of creeping to your life. Easiest way is violation of your personal borders as like rape as that is the most personal someone can ever get and that level of intimacy- if we don\'t straight condemn it what will we condemn. Being in shock is not enough you have to condemn the spirit to hell for what they have done. Being angry or bearing vengeance does nothing but give the spirit leverage over you. You either intersect the spirit and strike it down or condemn and wait for celestials to strike them down for you. But when enticing and beautiful women at least from your perspective rapes you or allures you to "consensual" union it is who let it happen- we let things happen all the time we don\'t raise voice because we don\'t value our health enough. And spirits know this- the more suffering our lives go through the number our response becomes and it is not only applicable for them but arguably maintained by the spirits in the world the direction we are heading as a society and mankind. And this will never end until the ignorance of our behavior disperse. You can turn inward and I promise you the spirit has nothing on you and never will- and the only way you turn inward is by taking care of the circadian rhythm- energy levels and diet. This way the body naturally calms down and reaches homeostasis it never had. And the violations we have in our lives doesn\'t happen without celestials approval- if pertains to destruction ignorance anything goes- and ignorance as in not knowing what any behavior results in- both in us and others.'

My main point was to express my disliking of the dichotomy set forth by the anon I was replying to- as his post implied that most/all spirits seek to drive men away from their principles- and/or that they mostly/all serve the being known to laymen as 'satan'. Of course- this is unfalsifiable - humans cannot get straight answers from unaccountable partially-intangible beings- and some (but not all) encounters with said beings may actually be made up or imagined- so at best these observations would be subjective- and at worst- completely fabricated.Nonetheless- my belief is that not all spirits seek to compromise one's principles- and the constant insistence otherwise can be simultaneously blamed on puritans & edgy theistic-satanists both looking for recruits for their respective groups."

Normal occultists don't deal with her- and I haven't seen a reason to eitherThat changes nothing. If a spirit is watching and wants to make contact- she will- particularly if you know it's possibleThat can do it too. I know somebody who got cursed can eventually gave in to the lies of the spiritAgreed- everyone should learn at least a littleThen yes/no isn't neededHer waiting for that is a very bad signAnon that's normal. Succubi apparently have an obsession with doing that to human men. Even from a benevolent succubus your lack of consent is just a lack of understandingAnd you couldn't do anythingAlternate interpretation: She's prompting you to learn magic the only way that will workNot real- it's something mine made up with literally no magical experience. You can just learn the actual skills insteadYou don't and never did have a succubusThe lockdowns triggered normies' schizo delusionsDrugs vary a lot by person. I've only rarely benefitted with my spirit but others are only able to have experiences high. Learn sober and then experiment if you want to"

There's a core of truth he falls back to every time somebody points out his lies. Motte an bailey argument iirc. Kundalini and breath work are important- therefor everything is parasites and bioelectricity. It's cleverI didn't read the text wall- but being a fragment of your higher self is a common belief in a lot of schools of thought. I very much doubt your higher self is sexually engaging with another lower entity (as opposed to the higher self of your succubus- which would actually make sense)Falset. woman who summoned both and can tell the differenceIt depends on both of you. A couple of years in- spirit sex is much stronger for me than 3dpdYou mean they all have a dad? No way!!! You know who also have dads? Human girls. Spooky...Being coded as something isn't the same as being that thingWhen returned to the sea of the unmanifest- nothing is masculine or feminine- anon. Those traits are components of manifestation itselfAre you sure about that?Be better at sex magic than the literal succubus. That's your only option. Feel free to try- btw. They'll be pleased you're helping them outThere are terrible things in the wild- though that might be an american thing because the entire two continents are populated by spirits of wickedness attracted by genocide (which is probably why palestinia is so horrid)The queens can if you summon them. A regular succubus might be able to. Doing kundalini yoga and meditating will help a lot. There's an astral projection technique that will also help if you know howIt doesn't matter where it goes- you should be capturing it regardless.

Imagine somebody being angry somebody christian referenced lambs in a bookOne of the spirits I'm no longer with used to look french and another looked welsh. Oddly specific? Maybe- but it's accurateTo be forgiven a sin one must repent- and christians never do. They're the lukewarm individuals that jesus spoke about. PatheticAnon... That was Inanna- probably. I have a hypothesis that all marian phenomena are just her larping as a pure innocent mother goddess who'd never lewd anyone (expect all the monks who have sexual experiences during prayer...)Try wikipedia. Baphomet is a thing and some occultists believe that Baphomet is real and a hermaphroditic demon. I'm not entirely sure either wayThat sounds right. Of course- it could also be some spirit who took on the persona after learning about it from humansIt's real and you can have kids. Congratulations- anon"

Summoning a love spirit results in some very different outcomes- and takes very different inputs- compared to making a tulpa.You can directly distinguish them by scanning. That's a topic in and of itself if you're a beginner and don't even know what scanning isand yes- some people have spirits which they think are tulpas (which did not originate from them- and were never a tulpa) and some people have a tulpa (which either did or currently is originating from them) which they think is a spiritthe thing is though- tulpas are spirits. And they can become fully fledged and independent from you- given enough time and development. The way they work is- a tulpa is a human spirit (like you)- but they start out from a fully formed human- rather than being born and having a body and having a normal human childhood. So they are disembodied human spirits- which is a little weird. Cuz they aren't dead- they just started out with no body.It's just a question of where it came from. Did it come from you- or did it come from the outside."

Not that "you can find a spirit amongst the vast multitude which will be compatible with you" though that is also true.If your preferences change- they will change to satisfy those new preferences. They kinda just want to make their partner happy. It\'s what they do. They\'re love spirits.There are some limits to this though. Mostly based on YOUR ability to embody the accompanying archetype. Meaning- if it\'s awkward for you and you don\'t really like being in that way- they\'ll go back to what ACTUALLY makes you happy.Cuz they do that. They listen to your subconscious- then do the thing that actually makes you happy.And also some of what they would actually enjoy giving. But spirits are weird man. They are very flexible mentally- far more than a normal human is. They can just morph and shift if they want to. Not just shapeshifting their appearance- deeper than that too.'

And the next step would be unifying these energies which often need the same gender meaning males would transform females and fuck males and females would transform males and fuck females- but none of your testimonies suggest this. Next controversy about you is of course your histrionic behavior which is prevalent through your whole existence here. And spirits after period of time can cause these things in you externally and since you have history with a tulpa or whatever you like to call it there is a valid concern for a need to propagate something you are not completely aware of or have experience with and like you have said multiple times before you don\'t actually have a spirit partner and these are your own words. Therefore we are in a situation where an eunuch is telling others how to have partner or how to proceed with a partner- why is not only the question but how- how could you? Then not only taking account the histrionic behavior but also the inflating of your perspective of the thing you actively try to shutdown anything else vaguely and repeatedly without confrontation- and by decades worth of experience I can say when something doesn\'t want to confront you they are lying or inexperienced- this the easiest test to see whether someone is out of their minds. Well I have countless other things to say but they are meaningless to me and probably you as you care only for yourself. The least of course would be for you to have the bare minimum control of your behavior before you some day actually interact with spirits in meaningful way besides your "yes I talk with goddesses" and at the same time show same symptoms seven years old do when they don\'t get their candy and throw tantrum at everyone at their vicinity- why not start by completing the circuit you would\'ve done it four years already given you start listening.'

Without complete circuit the body is in the mercy of its dominant energy flow- which in the case of human bodies is dictated by the biological gender until the circuit is complete. Similarly you cannot shapeshift between male and female gender unless the energies or balance of energies are matched with the assumed form otherwise there will be friction and you suffer from immense pain and contradiction. When discussing the mundane body your dna- environment and culture dictates how short lived or long lived these reactions and actions are- if there is no environmental or cultural hindrance you can with mind alone assume the gender or the mixture of both for as long as you like given there is energy- ordinarily the body aims for path of least resistance meaning it stops compensating and aims for inertia after period of time- being something you can't sustain long term is self-destructive. And repeatedly bringing forth these energies cause a shifting in your alignment meaning the energies have to flow different and then your body has to adapt- and sometimes these cause a tremendous consequences you cannot stop anymore such as insanity or complete overhaul of the ego that constructs and deconstructs rapidly. What I am trying to say living accordingly to your body is not only wise long term but only suitable solution- when the body is in frictionless state you lose inherent need to stir it.This is the insanity you face when the two mix and they will mix- and you have to mix them to be complete. You devour the old and upbring the new this is the spiritual path. Spirits are no different from us they can't stop living according to their energies- they have to. Their bodies don't possess the same inertia our does- no one does humans are unmatched in this regard."

If you were to cause reactions in the spirit you would need to know where you are aiming with these reactions or you are stirring the pot blind- by following the pacing spirits do you only need to pay attention when you are taking the lead you kind of have to know how the energies react and how they need to be paced to bring forth a change in how the energies flow and react. Too little proactiveness and inertia dilutes it too much proactiveness there will be friction which will destroy the buildup and so on. For spirits they utilize notions- the things we are accustomed to- our preferences and so on. But most importantly by being proactive they will get confirmation what is allowed and what isn't and most of the time they push the envelope. As what comes to energy changes and drawing of energy it has more to do with frequencies and uplifting than actual energy draw- at least with humans they don't need to draw that much energy from us like we think they do- they absolutely can draw you dry but there is no need. Proactive behavior draws energy because reaction always adapts to action if there was no reaction there was no energy to be interacted with. In some cases you react to the reaction from the counter part which is large portion of tantra- action initiates the cascading energies which reaction upkeeps. And generally speaking spirits don't intertwine these energies because it makes the effects way too loud or harsh to say which may take a toll on the body it is bold if you ask me to upkeep both energies or attempt to balance them- it is wiser to give them turns instead."

Feminine energies become proactive if there is no proactive energy dynamic in their life to react to. Same happens with us human females and males alike- if there is no reactiviness males become feminine- similarly if there is no proactiviness for feminine energies women become masculine. Meaning if the counterpart is amiss in ones life they are drawn to it then internally and the body does it themselves. And in many cases if its due to sexual frustration or something similar which we attribute a lot of our energies males may become feminine and females masculine. Bluntly stating you give feminine male chance to be proactive with feminine female they will become masculine should they choose so and masculine female chance to be reactive with masculine man they will become feminine. It is dictated by the energies alone nothing else. And once we complete the circuit by raising the spinal fluids up the spine this path or part of the prologue to ones spiritual path is to intertwine these energies as they will be intertwined sooner or later this will deconstruct the ego or way perceiving things and self only to be reconstructed. And for some reason people think that once the circuit is complete so is the spiritual path when in fact it is the beginning of spiritual path. This is the fast and easy part- understanding the energies is what takes the lifetime. Spirits- locations and memories we amass are nothing but company to this not the path or destination. And the way easterners oversee the completion of the circuit is a joke they don't take you to the dark places they avoid at all costs these pitfalls when in fact these dark places and entities are who reveal the nasty truth about our reality."

Majority of people will never hear a spirit nor see one yet majority of people deem themselves spiritual in some sense they either believe in a god or admit that there is something higher to our existence. In regards to amorous unions the person who is undergoing it knows exactly how it feels and proceeds over time- they know what is their highest experience with the spirit yet when will the breakthrough happen when the doubt exits the body? Once you are aware where this originates from- and you cannot know it unless the circuit is complete. In this sense amorous unions are bad for us since you are blind to the sphere you don't push yourself towards the development because you think you are development in progress- at least this is the premise with ones who interact with spirits they falsely believe there is progress behind their interactions. The moment you can see- interact- observe and influence spirits on your own without the help of the spirit you are fit to operate and explore- before that we are being shown what we want to see and when we want to see. I talk this way because it cannot be addressed enough- it has to be addressed repeatedly until people investigate it. Your health that is- what else do you have or anyone has. Stick to it and develop your health everything else follows. This is the sole responsibility and we have to choose it all travesty of our worlds comes from inadequate health. Have you seen blissful and happy person ever commit a crime what about hateful and bitter person? This is more relevant than ever before."

It's possible to confuse a spirit for a tulpa- but that doesn't make it one. If you don't like the creation definition- a tulpa is an entity that lives in a physical body. Therefor you're a tulpa- which is what tulpamancers would agree to. Since succubi don't share your body- they aren't tulpasSpirits feel external in the way physical people feel external- They don't give the same head pressures and overlaid emotions that tulpas do. I have a tulpa and have been with a few spirits- so I can tell the difference easily. Invocation is the process of calling a spirit temporarily into your body and can be similar- but they don't feel as attached as a tulpa doesYou're just admitting to trying to curse people now? Maybe what happened to survivoranon happen to you- but without the friendly succubi who want to helpEntirely predictable. Don't summon succubi or incubi if you're completely opposed to sexual stuffNot improbable- actually. It's a shame you're a straight guy now- or you'd probably be more open to him (assuming it's not a lie- obviously)AwwwThat's the fun part- you don't. The entire op says to be careful about summoning because they're hard to banish. Incubi are worse than succubi about that. Summon one of the queens to ask for help- I guess. Maybe that'll work- maybe she'll say you're an adorable couple and throw a wedding instead"

Hormones initiate the developments in our body and pace the growth- and for example you can accumulate excess estrogen to your body easily through diet- bad gut flora- chronic stress and prescription drugs. Estrogen is probably the number one culprit to our lethargic society as it asserts great toll on our bodies worsening the underlying problems- it promotes cell growth and energy cycling this way it draws a lot of energy destabilizing your energy body and the way your body tries to compensate is through lethargy. It also may be that these persons have inadequately developed energy bodies meaning their body doesn\'t gravitate to their natural alignment or sexual tendencies making them suffer more than others as the system can\'t run optimally and be at peace. But I don\'t see any problem for their development should they undertake and in contrary it is probably far more fulfilling than it would for a normal person who developed per their dna. If their energies intertwine naturally they could probably master both energies with ease as they have dealt with them their whole lifetime already- not perhaps to their extremes but are very familiar with those. I haven\'t thought or explores this aspect as much and it would be fascinating to meet one and see how their energies react or develop. With spirits this is no problem if the system is already operational you can change however you like it as long as the energies and flow match the body.Never have and never had the need. It is an observation about your behavior as you slash out at individuals- what else is it then than what I said? Instead of redirecting your claim from my "lies" now represent one.'

I think you\'re not gonna want to hear this- but I feel like you need to challenge the notion that "some" sexual activity among a male friend group is a thing that purely straight people do.Like- the concept of "Homosexual" is very straightforward- and doesn\'t have exceptions carved out based on who bottoms- or "platonic sex acts" or what-have-you.If that\'s your local culture (which determines whether its "normal")- then its at least a tiny bit gay- and there\'s nothing wrong with that.With all that in mind- its worth asking yourself if this incubus is responding to latent desires on your part.For example- are you one of the many people who often thinks- "It would be so much nicer/more relaxing/relatable/whatever if girls were just a little more like guys..."'

Interestingly however- such a flight would have been impossible- because Byrd was at that time in Antarctica as a part of Operation Highjump. GIannini would later claim that Byrd travelled in secret from the south pole to the north pole to undertake a secret expedition- but there is no evidence for it. and if you think about it it makes no sense - if the north and south pole are both a part of the same ice wall with land beyond them- why would Byrd not have just undertaken a flight across the antarctic to see the land beyond the southern pole?'

You have simply been made aware of this as it was foreseen and known. Consider that you can't avoid this inevitability. How would you react?",b'You missed the point again.I will attempt to explain it for you again using simple questions.You wrote "if"That is an admission that God is not omniscient. Do you understand why this is so? Do you understand why God not knowing the outcome of everything means God lacks omniscience? Knowing anything less than everything means lacking omniscience. A poor example as it fails to reach at the crux of the issue. A better example isIf God KNEW that you would arrive at 4 by adding 2 + 2- then it is not possible to arrive at 4 by adding 3+1 or any other method. If God "knew" that you\'d arrive at 4 from 2+2 but instead you arrived at 4 from 3+1- then God would be wrong and his "knowledge" would be exposed as mere prediction. I cannot imagine anyone above a certain IQ threshold failing to understand this straightforward logic.'

You have simply been made aware of this as it was foreseen and known. Consider that you can't avoid this inevitability. How would you react?",b'There is however a way to interpret that sentence fragment in a way that is not inconsistent or a poor argument. However- this requires us to interpret "only" to mean that God lacks full knowledge. For instance- he is aware only of outcomes (=4) and >ignorant< of methods (2+2)But once again- if God is ignorant of anything- he lacks omniscience.In effect- by making the claim that God possesses knowledge only of outcomes- he is reduced from omniscience to merely a kind of clairvoyant. Similar to an oracle. If you meant this- then that is no longer an inconsistent religious belief. However- it does open up more interesting questions about the nature of God.'

How would you react?",b"Of course- if God is knowledgeable of all outcomes yet ignorant of methods- this is itself a kind of paradox because every outcome is the result of millions of previous outcomes.For example- Julius Caesar winning the Roman civil war was an outcome of his success in multiple battles. Yet these battlefield victories were the outcome of tactical and strategic decisions. And these decisions were the outcome of circumstance and previous decisions and circumstances. Which were themselves the outcomes of millions of previous outcomes.So where does God's clairvoyance suddenly cut out?Why is his knowledge filled with such inconsistent gaps?It would be as though someone else is showing him incomplete glimpses of the future. And this is the being we must be very interested in. Who is showing God visions of the future?"

If God knows that Julius Caesar WILL win the civil war- then Julius Caesar cannot lose.This is absolutely basic logic. If x = 4 than x =/= 5So we are right back where we began anyway. Predetermination. So long as you demand people believe that outcomes are pre-determined- intelligent people will point out that pre-determined outcomes necessitate predetermination.'

I am currently at a point I can physically see them as a colorless mist that can at times go to a hazy fog and to a gas / flame like motion when it grows in intensity. I'm trying to get to a point where I can discern what I hear in my mind is them and not projecting something from my own imagination. I know there have been times where it was them due to things they pointed out outside of my awareness but I've yet to grasp a means of distinction which is them at the moment.This is not a well known spirit or deity figure as they were the ones that reached out to me via dreams and as an aspiration. They identify as fae and don't seem to want offerings but dose seem to appreciate energy offerings and just getting my attention. By I've also taken up trying scrying- use black crystals- and tarot but they discourage tarot it seems. That is if I'm right- thus my problem. Does this become easier over time?"

If you hold that long enough- you should be able to flip to spirit vision. However- you should stop trying to see with your eyes (if you are) and try to perceive as if changing the channel on a TV. It takes time. Stop trying to discern. Take what comes and only later consider what was or wasn't the spirit. You will learn to differentiate the subtle qualities of genuine contact- but trying to force that (because you're grasping for a feeling you haven't learned to hook onto) will distract.Dharana practice is the most straightforward way to train concentration. Otherwise just keep at it- and train all your astral senses. Concentrate on the body of light and it will become more stable."

I tired using an old golden arrow head nickels for dowsing and I saw it attempt to try and move it but it couldn't seem to do it for some reason.I'm pretty much seeing this with with my physical eyes but can still see it when closing them. I kinda have to focus just a small bit and it starts up on command and I notice it seems to get a bit more patient when near water. Been debating trying scrying with water but I have server lower back pains so probably can't do it for long sessions. Might just keep a bowl of water near by just stop see if it effects anything. Now one entity that I believe was separate from the one I communicate with did a forced mental projection to where I was kinda seeing both with my eyes and my minds eye. It was hard to describe like it was an overlay I had no control over. Only could make out an outline of a short being walking out from behind a tree stop look at me then walked off fading. Felt like it was more their doing then my own. I'll see if I can try to do the channel changing- I just know with my eyes closes its nothing but vast amounts of various outlines blending into a background of endless shapes and colors.Ok well I guess if somethings wrong they'll try to correct me lateran or I'll eventually figure this out. I try to do that and just note what I think was and was from the afterwards. I appreciate the insight"

It\xe2\x80\x99s the furthest of the astrological planets because it\xe2\x80\x99s the very bounds of the self- not because it\xe2\x80\x99s the highest. But neither Da\xe2\x80\x99ath nor Kether can have any planet that truly can encapsulate them- but that\xe2\x80\x99s the thing- the planetary forces are in yetzirah; a realm of clear cult concepts and archetypes where something like the unmanifest and infinite become manifest and finite- so the irony of incomprehensible things like Kether and Da\xe2\x80\x99at becoming linked to the manifested forces of Neptune- Kether\xe2\x80\x99s unknowability becoming Neptune\xe2\x80\x99s classic murky infinite depths and force of illusion and madness- and Pluto- with Da\xe2\x80\x99ath\xe2\x80\x99s emptiness manifesting as the opposite as pure mass and gravity (because opposites imply opposites into reality) - is a reality. Like how ayin is nothingness but also a letter and a path. With all this in mind- Neptune is clearly Kether because it is the root of Yeztirah. The collective unconsciousness and the whirling of all ideas as it manifests from the unmanifest- an echo of Kether- comprehensible and symbolic incomprehensibility- and it is genuinely the plane where psychedelics take you/are linked to. Man- Pluto also leaves this reddish decay behind way after you evoke anything to do with it- kind of like Mars. And it has this distinct smell of death. Gives anyone around it a headache.'

I have a drum and bell which I use for other things that could be used. I had a dream several months ago that was very vivid. I was in an empty lot where 4 harpies came at me. I just smiled at them and instantly and without thought laid myself down on the ground and said " partake of my body so that my impurities may give you energy and my purities may nourish you" they came and feasted on me.

In the meantime Lama Tsultrim Alione (of Tara Mandala) wrote a book about a type of informal ch\xc3\xb6d you can do without empowerment called "Feeding Your Demons." I think they might have a website with simple instructions actuallyJust go slow and stop if you feel discomfort. Even this form of the practice can be destabilizing if you\'re not ready for itThis is bs that will wreck your energy system or at best do nothing. Really all these new-age-style chakra meditations are like this. Don\'t do it. It\'s bad to pour a bunch of energy into your head/"third eye" with just visualization. That pain you were feeling was telling you that you were doing something wrong. Learn tummo or similar systems from a real tradition if you want to work with chakras. The Hadean book Stoking the Witchfire is a good place to startLove is the law.'

It does not mean that there is an universal tally saying "if you do this- this will happen to you"- it is a lot more subtle. Karma is a function of existence- flapping you eyelashes generates Karma- as do your thoughts/actions and whatever the fuck is all your aggregates are doing. Karma is categorized as Good/Bad/Neutral as are its consequences. In general it is believed that generating a lot of good Karma will get you closer to liberation- but if you\'re looking for a scientific definition of the different Karma types you\'re going to be shit out of luck.I\'m not sure thinking of Karma in terms of it helping you do "impossible" things makes much sense.'

Make sure you only use them for communicating with people you have or are going to meet IRL- don't get sucked in.Step four: Use those platforms and other ones like meetup(com) to find others with your interests.Step five: Go to general meetings of these placesStep six: Make friends and add them on social mediaStep seven: Use social media to organize smaller meetings outside of the organization with your new friends- possibly even 1 on 1 if she's hotStep eight: ProfitDon't worry if you don't have social skills- the only way to develop them is through practice. Save some girls for me anon. Be confident- the internet drains confidence. I recommend using it less."

You can analyze your issues by confronting the shit that makes you uncomfortable. Know thyself. Don't go full retard and start doing abhorrent shit that will not teach you anything.People put up masks in front of others all the time; face- facade- persona- whatever you want to call it. Putting on a mask while looking in the mirror just gives distorted self image and makes insight impossible.Maybe you'll gain nothing from the experience and have to attempt another method. If you do have some kind of aversion- then you may wish to try and figure out why.Insight."

The Enochian heptarchia disks are simply wooden craft disks that I used a compass and paint to paint the angelic names and ensigns on.

The goetic apron was made with simple mass-produced black server's apron with the pocket carefully removed (used a seam splitter)- and the image was printed on using a heat transfer vinyl by way of a cricut machine."

For a VERY long time. but for some reason I just kept up with it.. and one day it just suddenly clicked. I actually started understanding Agrippa. Re read all of my occult books- practiced another year- it clicked again. Like my brain just had to subconsciously process all of this info- visualization and etheric movement in the background for a long time (but your mileage may vary). Even though I have done these rites for so long- I feel like I'm at the real beginning of my journey. Keep up with it- study when it strikes you- and one day when you least expect it it'll start falling into place. And when it does- you'll be so glad you did your daily rituals. Also screw that other dude- echols is just fine. He practiced magick a thousand times longer than the cumulative practices of people ITT. Is he right about everything? nope- but neither am I. He's a good voice to have when you're building this life for yourself.Also here's another pic- golden dawn ritual tools I've made"

When you practice something like Qabalah- you are accessing the currents of power carved out through the power of all the people that practiced it before. When you participate in a given current- you become subject to the trends within it- the grooves carved out over time that form reality according to what forms power takes. This is also true of direct magical lineage- but for a much smaller chain of people rather than just the overarching forces.We also affect these currents and carve grooves out by our participation in the world. Magic might seem arbitrary because seemingly incompatible descriptions of the world can be real (or real enough) simultaneously. We contribute to the maintenance and progression of the world- and with sufficient power can create branches in a current if not change its direction altogether. When we talk about a Magus speaking His Word- that is the change we describe. In short- what I call power directly forms the subjective experience that we call reality. Shared descriptions of reality- or consesus reality- bound what is considered possible. It is easier to accomplish seemingly impossible feats alone than it is in a group- because you are competing with the consesus of all those around you. These realities are subjective- of course- and therefore illusory- and that is why the Magus is also called the Lord of Illusion. See the so-called curse of the Magus for more on that.'

There are also adjacent spells that people will use to get around this- where instead of it being a love spell- it will be a spell to make the other person think of you a lot- or make them break up with their current partner- etc. I would not say they are uncommon though- we get someone asking for a spell to spiritually rape someone at least a few times a week. In fact- I think romantic attachments are one of the primary motivators for random people to get interested into trying magic because of their sheer desperation. However from my experience I would say that most of the time the people that try this sort of stuff or try to buy a spell of some random witch on tiktok are unsuccessful. If your ex is /x/pilled and has no moral compass I would not put it past him to try some shit to get you back- but I would not get too worried unless you really are experiencing some insane shit.'

Now it happened.I was taking a nap and in my dream I called out to Dantelion. He appeared. At first he appeared male and talked to me. I asked him whether he found my offering satisfactory or whether he wanted something else. He said he wants a specific salad with tomatoes- cucumbers and mushrooms instead. I then asked him what he thinks of another demon- I don\'t remember which name I dropped- but it might have been Sitri. He chuckled and said "the one who\'s higher than Paimon? His real name is Arvarv (or something like that)". I took this to mean that he\'s more powerful than Paimon- even though according to old grimoires Paimon should be more powerful...Dantalion then changed into a more female appearance- with a bad tail and bat wings- hovering in the air. The dream ended after that. At no point did I feel scared.Absolutely fascinating experience.'

They are cunning and do not have your best interest in mind. They will trick and use you the first chance they get. The more you work with them the more negative energy they will attract in your life. This is an unpopular opinion most forums about magic (specially this site) since a lot of people that get interested in this stuff are edgelords- but all the people I know personally who have worked with demons in the past say that at some point they realize that it isnt worth it. Unless you are trying to do evil shit- there is not a lot of things that demons can help you with that angels cannot in terms of practical magic.'

It's a good read regardless and would recommend itYou should literally take anything occult with a grain of salt- even big names like Crowley and Evola. If you lose your scepticism with the mysteries its pretty easy to be mislead at any rate no matter how advanced- and you also got to know that there is some shit you will just never know and have to be ok with not knowing."

All I did was a non evocation method with Bathin for safe travels to South America by burning a globe shaped candle with his name inscribed on it- the second night when going to sleep- I felt like I was picked up by him- astral projected to my location. Asked me if it was where I needed to go- I said yes- he said "done". As far as the travelling part went- it was the most seamless travel that I ever had- no bureaucratic hiccups- no shady taxis- no late flights and no cunt of an NPC asked me to produce my vaccination status- I also wasn\'t even bothered by customs even though I told customs to their face what I had and they didnt even bother searching me when I came back home with some of the stuff I brought back. This was JUST non-evocation. I\'ve done connective evocation once of Astaroth- looking for more meaningful work. I sort of half got an answer- I ended up just finding out that it was a skill that I really needed to learn. I asked for close to the impossible with forcalour for a death to occur without any input. No one died but said person did get plenty of injuries- so there is that.'

After doing the cardinal directions saying YHVH- adonai etc- when I do the qabbalistic cross I imagine myself zooming out and out and out until I see nothing and essentially reunite with the god-head. I then say the four archangels as such and visualize them. I do away with the visualisation of the hexagram and pentagram after the 4 archangels from the GD system and instead I will then say above me "Metatron/Rahoorkuit/Yodhehvahheh" you can take your pick- because its the symbolism that matters- I then say within me (whatever god form you identify with) and they say below me Satanel- I am currently trying saying below me Lilith. The field of protection should not just be the four directions but also above- within and below you. I then say the opening again and close it that way.'

I don\'t have a named entity for it tho. What do you use for visualization? Metatron I do a sphere of light descending through me to make a circle/spotlight spread from beneath my feet. For "From below" I did darkness that moves up to that circle and spreads from the middle making it a white ring beneath my feet. But part of me thinks it should move through my center to above me.

The reason is just because I think it's really cool. My body turns numb- I start feeling like I'm floating around- my mind's eye becomes vivid.My question is- how does one go deeper into trance? I start with box breathing- and then once I'm relaxed I imagine falling- and that generally get the dissociative floating feel (not sure why).But what do I do after that? Feels like a bit of a blue balls. Is there a way to go even deeper and get more sensations? Can I transition into a dream? Would love to know your guys' experience with trance and meditation."

I hang around there because everyone is generally nice and sociable and are good at magic. I believe- from the opening post- that the thread is all about finding the Nobody. He is an enigmatic figure that passes down his teachings to others- or in some way- inspires them through the efficacy and power of his personhood and magical capabilities.I think it's an interesting topic- and though I've heard that the thread is a containment thread- I don't really see it that way. If the mods are tired of it- I'm sure they could just ban it from the boards- but it's been a constant on this board for a long time- so maybe the mods don't mind it.Anyway- I hope this answers your question- and thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak my mind on the issue. It's very appreciated.Also- captcha =SAAAR"

Am I you? Surely not- and therefore if I gave you an answer then you should call me a liar- and a larper even.I know you don't and that's why you make silly comments about hiking up a mountain thinking you're a wizard. That is not what this is about. There is no need to hike up the mountain- and you should not ever think you are a wizard.The first difference you will find will be in exactly this way- that your perception of reality will be different and you will see more clearly and objectively- therefore be able to make better decisions for yourself. You will be able to focus more clearly on your desires and whatever task is set before you. This alone can make you rich.What is greater than gold- however- is what will come to you after truly dedicating yourself to this life. Gaining access to wisdom and information that would take years- even decades- for most others to understand. The ability to utilize the dreamstate in a functional and productive way- and to live on eternally in the spirit realm with a body made of light.This is a stage of human development that has been lost- and it not only unlocks psychic powers but allows us to ascend to a dimension beyond the physical. Anything you can imagine can be realized- with greater speed and greater awe the more you practice. The more of the brain you utilize- the more capable you will be- and the more you will believe - and the more you believe- the more truly magical your abilities may become.Imagine over the course of a few years you go from what you are now- to a highly performant version of that- into then attaining clairvoyance- remote viewing- lucid dreaming- even moving objects with the mind. I've seen a man drive a pencil through a table without damaging either the pencil nor the table.This is about gaining true freedom in life to do as you desire- not magic."

However- the Eastern wizards who practice sexual abstention are not doing it to retain their semen. They are in the business of redirecting their sexual energy into something else. Not orgazming alone does nothing cause you can easily expend all that energy farting all day or fueling your anxiety. First step is to learn to refocus the sexual energy."

I have made my heart his throne- and my body his temple- and it is from here that he hears me- guides me- and heals me.It\'s magic to you because you don\'t understand how it\'s done. Once you understand- you realize it\'s not a trick - it\'s simply something anyone can do if they learn the skill; but this kind does not come out without much meditation and fasting. You will be interacting with elements of this realm that are not usually perceptible- and reality will much more easily bend to you- people will feel your presence in the room and gravitate towards you. All sorts of things like this you will begin to notice along the journey.Imagine consciousness like water. Normies usually only receive a small drip of consciousness through their brain due to their poor lifestyles and toxic diet- with calcified pineal glands and such.Extreme meditators are able to tap into a much larger pool- say a river in comparison- such that they are able to perceive far more and process/intuit information at much greater speed. This is why some people are so easily able to outmaneuver normies and get ahead in life - they have higher access to consciousness and are able to utilize more of their brains than the default mode network that normies are caught up in.The brain is capable of far many more things than we realize. It is able to interact with electromagnetic and quantum fields in ways that are to be tested and experienced- limits unknown. Heaven on earth possible.One does wonder about if we were to master this ability- what would we look like- and would matter continue to exist at all?'

Switzerland was neutral- so was Sweden- Spain was having a civil war- Great Britain had no means to mount an amphibious invasion- intervention into the war was unpopular in the USA until Japan attacked- and France was retarded.Clearly not since they got their shit pushed in back to Berlin by the USSR. And this is with the surprise attack breaking the Molotov\xe2\x80\x93Ribbentrop Pact- massive gains with Operation Barbarossa capturing most of the European USSR- and Stalin handicapping the Red Army after having deleting most of his officer corps prior to the invasion and still yet not delegating power to his marshals and generals until he allowed Zhukov and Vasilevsky launch Operation Uranus completing the greatest encirclements in military history deleting the Wehrmacht\'s Sixth Army at Stalingrad and finally ending the longest and deadliest battles in history being the Battle of Stalingrad.Despite millions of causalities- the USSR and Red Army was STRONGER than it was in the beginning of the war after facing the "strongest military on earth" in an almost 4 year war- with the Red Army going on to curbstomp the Japanese armies in a few weeks right after- and Nazi Germany was reduced into partitions among the Allies. Tell me how that works.Definitely not by claiming you are the master race- channeling demons for "hidden powers-" and cloaking your nation under occultism.'

It can be the equivalent of the short term out of body condition that is experienced after the final disconnect from the body.. but that's not quite what it is by default; you really do have to accumulate a lot of experience to be able to be clearly and well oriented to the out of body circumstances.One thing that will very much assist in your understanding of what the afterlife consists of will be the visits you experience with the people who you have been close to during the time of their deaths and the subsequent few days as they get oriented to their circumstances or are guided around by the beings that assist in the transitions away from one life to eventually be reseated into another body. One of the things that they do is to take the recently deceased person- out of body obviously- to visit with the people who they have unfinished connections to during the sleep phase of consciousness.. If you have not developed your ability to see clearly and retain long term focus while in these phases of consciousness you may become confused very easily and even indulge in various forms of self generated illusion imagery..I have personal experience with this and have more experience than I can easily explain to those who have not also been spending years in the process of developing their own perception beyond the mundane physical linear context of our existence"

When he looked into the blue man\'s eyes he seemed startled- as if surprised the child could see him. Then he disappeared.In the comments- another person posted a link to a podcast. In the podcast episode- a man describes 5 different encounters with a blue man that used to "watch him while he slept"- and that if he awoke and saw the man he would disappear.Then the comment section blows up and a bunch of people are linking from past threads and stuff- all about encounters with these blue people who look just like normal people and even have somewhat conventional looking clothing- but they are blue and surprised when you can see them.I searched reddit further and found numerous encounters with these blue people and all of the encounters are essentially identical.1. Experiencer is always asleep or trying to sleep or waking up from sleep.2. Subject is always young- only one of the people who had an experience claimed that they were an adult when it happened- all other accounts were from childhood.3. When confronted or directly viewed- the blue people would observe for only a short time and then leave.4. They are always blue.other interesting points in the accounts:1. The blue people appeared sometimes as male and sometimes as female.2. The blue people sometimes appear to be wearing clothing- and sometimes not.4. The blue people sometimes do not have a face.5. They vary in size from slightly smaller than a person- so slightly taller- but most are the same size as a person.6. Often times the same person would have a series of interactions with the same blue person many times over many years.Anyone have similar experiences or have an idea of what this could be?
